# NLP With LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks #
The problem is about the sentimental analysis of the tweets which are basically reviews about the movies.
This problem is divided into 10 tasks so each task can be understood easily.
Training data is in the data folder. It's just a simple problem to make your hands dirty with LSTM and RNN. Play around with the hyperparameters to see different results.

Happy Coding :)
